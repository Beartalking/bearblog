## I want to be this kind of senior

I worked with a few talented designers and leaders before. A legacy they left for me is the question, "what would he/she do in this situation?"

When I'm working on tricky problems, I will ask myself, "what will they do?"

Now I realise that's the power of the role model from a senior. It's not about solving problems for juniors but showing an example of how to solve problems.

I want to be this kind of a senior.

我之前曾与一些才华横溢的设计师和领导者一起工作。 他们留给我的遗产是一个问题，“他/她在这种情况下会做什么？”

当我处理棘手的问题时，我会问自己：“他们会做什么？”

现在我意识到这就是前辈榜样的力量。 这不是为新人解决问题，而是展示如何解决问题的示例。

我想成为这样的前辈。
