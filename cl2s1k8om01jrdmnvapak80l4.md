As a design mentor, one thing that I quite enjoy doing is reviewing the study progress with my students.

Learning a UX course is a journey that involves months, and there're ups and downs. So we might focus on the details and don't see the real progress. Also, don't get me started on the self-doubting part. That's why we need to review it from a holistic point of view.

The whole course can be measured by progress percentage, and when a student completes a unit, the percentage will be marked as completed. I usually check the student's progress diagram once in a few weeks with them, and we talk about it. We analyse the data, list out the positive things that we can learn and duplicate, and check the negative kinds of stuff we want to avoid. It's a data analysis practice for real and for themselves!

For example, by checking the flat parts and spikes from the diagram and reviewing the related units, students without a science background might find the user flow units difficult to complete. Similarly, students who don't have any graphic design exercises find user interface units challenging.

My job as a design mentor is to help them see those things from their own data and plan a better way for their future study. So every time I see their "aha!" faces when we have some insights, that just make my day.

That's how I find data is powerful when you can see things behind it.

作为一名设计导师，我非常喜欢做的一件事是和我的学生一起回顾学习进度。

学习用户体验课程是一个需要数月的旅程，并且有起有落。所以我们可能只关注细节而看不到真正的进展。另外，不要让我开始自我怀疑。这就是为什么我们需要从整体的角度来审视它。

整个课程可以通过进度百分比来衡量，当学生完成一个单元时，百分比将被标记为完成。我通常会在几周内与他们一起检查一次学生的进度图，然后我们会谈论它。我们分析数据，列出我们可以学习和复制的积极事物，并检查我们想要避免的消极事物。这是真实的和为自己的数据分析实践！

例如，通过检查图表中的扁平部分和尖峰并查看相关单元，没有科学背景的学生可能会发现用户流单元难以完成。同样，没有任何图形设计练习的学生会发现用户界面单元具有挑战性。

我作为设计导师的工作是帮助他们从自己的数据中看到这些东西，并为他们未来的学习计划更好的方法。所以每次我看到他们的“啊哈！”表情，当我们有一些见解时，这会让我很开心。

这就是我发现当你能看到它背后的东西时，数据是强大的。
