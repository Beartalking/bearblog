## Sketchnote for a speech on UX New Zealand

I watched a few recordings of [UX New Zealand](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ux-new-zealand/) last week and took some visual notes from those sessions. Sharing them here and starting from this great speech by [Tiane Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAJruhMBB9xkiHs_u_af2DhTwd8JAHg1_DM), the UX Research Lead at Google: Remote Research with Novice Internet Users.

Key learnings:

ðŸ’¡ Pay attention to language
ðŸ’¡ Find a local expert to bridge the gap
ðŸ’¡ Research localization
