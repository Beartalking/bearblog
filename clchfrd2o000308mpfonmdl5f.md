# Differentiating Human-Made Content in the Age of AI

I’ve tried a few AI options for creating content, including Midjourney, ChatGPT and Notion AI. A big question: in this age where AI can generate pixel-perfect images and well-refined copy in a few seconds, what’s the value of humans creating stuff? What could be the differentiator?

In the age of artificial intelligence, where automation and computer-generated content are becoming more commonplace, how do humans recognise and leverage our unique strengths and abilities that machines cannot replicate? One of the most effective and impactful ways to accomplish this is using hand-drawn doodles/illustrations.

Doodles bring a unique quality to content, allowing it to stand out in the sea of computer-generated content. They evoke emotion and draw the viewer in, providing a creative and dynamic perspective that cannot be replicated with automation. This is why doodles have become a powerful tool for content creators in the digital age.

I did some illustrations last year as a personal project to demonstrate some design/product terminologies in a simple way for non-tech people. The result was excellent; many people reached out to me, saying thank you, as they found it easy to understand and digest. I don’t think AI can do something similar soon. And the personal touch is the differentiator.

The use of hand-drawn doodles can also be used to give a personal touch to content, allowing content creators to connect with their audience in a more meaningful way. In addition, hand-drawn doodles allow creators to showcase their creativity, personality, and uniqueness in a way impossible with automated content.

Ultimately, hand-drawn doodles are a significant differentiator for human-made content in the age of AI. They provide a unique and creative perspective, allowing content creators to stand out and connect with their audience in a meaningful way.

If you have already read through here - most of the copy above was written by AI (ChatGPT), and I made the illustrations. So this prob the proper way to work with AI.

我已经尝试了一些创造内容的人工智能选项，包括Midjourney、ChatGPT和Notion AI。一个大问题：在这个人工智能可以在几秒钟内生成像素完美的图像和精炼的文案的时代，人类创造东西的价值是什么？什么可以成为差异化的因素？

在人工智能时代，自动化和计算机生成的内容越来越普遍，人类如何认识和利用机器无法复制的独特优势和能力？实现这一目标的最有效和最有影响力的方法之一是使用手绘的涂鸦/插图。

涂鸦给内容带来独特的质量，使其在计算机生成的内容海洋中脱颖而出。它们能唤起人们的情感，吸引观众，提供一种创造性和动态的视角，这是自动化所无法复制的。这就是为什么涂鸦已经成为数字时代内容创作者的一个强大工具。

我去年做了一些插图，作为一个个人项目，以简单的方式向非技术人员展示一些设计/产品术语。结果非常好；许多人向我表示感谢，因为他们认为这很容易理解和消化。我不认为人工智能可以很快做类似的事情。而个人魅力是差异化的因素。

使用手绘涂鸦也可以为内容赋予个人色彩，让内容创作者以更有意义的方式与受众联系。此外，手绘涂鸦允许创作者展示他们的创造力、个性和独特性，这在自动化内容中是不可能的。

最终，在人工智能时代，手绘涂鸦是人类制造的内容的一个重要区别。它们提供了一个独特和创造性的视角，使内容创作者能够脱颖而出，并以一种有意义的方式与他们的观众联系起来。

如果你已经读完了这里--上面的大部分文案是由人工智能（ChatGPT）写的，而我做了插图。所以这可能是与AI合作的正确方式。
