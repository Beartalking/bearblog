### **Overview of Designer Roles: Understanding the Different Types**

UX designer, UI designer, product designer, web designerâ€”there are so many types of designers. What's the difference between them? I will explain in this short video to help you understand clearly. We know there are many designer roles in this world, and some roles are quite easy to discern based on their titles. For example, an interior designer, graphic designer, printing designer, or industrial designer. However, some other roles, especially these four: UX, UI, web, and product, are not so straightforward. It's quite confusing. Let's talk about them one by one.

### **The Role of a UX Designer: Experts in User Experience**

A UX designer deals with user experience problems. This means that if you want to build a website, a service, or a product, you need to solve the logic behind it and clarify user flows. You also want to understand the entire customer experience according to their journey.

### **The Role of a UI Designer: Masters of Visual Interaction**

UI stands for user interface. For example, if you're building a website, the appearance of that website or the visual elements on the website are managed by a UI designer. As a UI designer, you deal with all the visual and interaction elements.

### **The Role of a Web Designer: Architects of Web Experiences**

As the title suggests, a web designer generally focuses on web experiences. If you're building a website or a service via websites, that would fall under a web designer's responsibility.

### **The Role of a Product Designer: Curators of Comprehensive Product Experiences**

Product design is a bit more complex because a product designer is in charge of the entire product experience and also needs to consider the longer lifespan of the customer experience. It encompasses everything from finding the product, beginning to use it, and including the exit from the product. Here, 'product' usually refers to a digital product in most scenarios, such as a webpage, a website, an app, or other digital services based on the web.

### **Distinguishing Between Designer Roles: UX, UI, Web, and Product**

Regarding the differences between these roles, a UX designer needs to understand the logic behind things and be able to create wireframes, user flows, and test their assumptions. A UI designer needs to specialize in graphics and visuals. A web designer should understand how to build a website visually and ideally have some front-end knowledge and experience, such as HTML or CSS. A product designer combines UX and UI but also needs to understand the business and have some product management or product team working experience, such as understanding agile and building a product roadmap.

### **Choosing Your Path in Design: Aligning Your Career with Your Strengths**

In conclusion, all these four options are excellent career choices because they are well-paid and offer numerous job opportunities. You are more likely to work in the high-tech industry, which offers many growth opportunities. Consider your strengths and weaknesses, and then make the right decision. For example, if you have a graphic design background, you might choose the UI designer role. I hope this makes sense. Stay tuned for more videos to explain UX design, product, and technology.
