I don't like those 20 under 20s, 30 under 30s campaigns. Media contributes a lot to people's anxiety nowadays, and those lists are really good examples.

There's no planned schedule for your life; if so, what actually happens will more likely be different from the plan.

Yes, Steve Jobs became a millionaire at 24, and Mark Zuckerberg founded Facebook at 19, but so what? Many people build their businesses in their 40s or 50s just when they figure out the direction.

In my defence, Frodo Baggins leaves the Shire for his One Ring journey at the age of...50! He will fail on any Forbes 30 Under 30 lists for sure, but he still saved the whole world!

(Yep, I was surprised when reading that fact in the book)
