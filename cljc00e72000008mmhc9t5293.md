After browsing through the Config2023 website, there are about 21 specific talks that I'm interested in. Each one lasts about 45 minutes, and including note-taking time, it's about an hour each, so 21 hours in total.  
  
Being a product designer, maintaining professional competitiveness in the tech field is indeed not easy. Just learning from the three major annual events - Google I/O, WWDC and Config - takes about 100 hours of my time.  
  
Of course, if I choose not to watch or learn, being an average-level designer is still an option, but it's dangerous. I've been through the Photoshop golden age and saw many talented designers stopped there and didn't improve, felt a shame.
