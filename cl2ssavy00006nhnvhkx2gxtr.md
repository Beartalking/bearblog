So many negative things these days, and I decided to stay positive (not that positive!) I also wanted to transfer that attitude and nudge people to focus on good things, and I did it with a silly mask🤪

Drew this silly mask this morning in 5 mins and already got my daughter, and a lady in the supermarket smiled - quite a good outcome 😄

Bad things will fade away anyway, but the feeling will stay. So, why don’t we focus on our feelings, and nurture them with good intentions?

这些天有很多负面的事情，我决定保持积极（不是那种positive！）我也想传递这种态度并推动人们专注于好的事情，用一个傻口罩做到了🤪

今天早上用5分钟画了这个傻面具，已经让我的女儿和超市里的一位女士笑了-结果很好😄

不管怎样，坏事都会消失，但感觉会一直存在。 那么，我们为什么不专注于我们的感受，并以良好的意愿培养它们呢？
