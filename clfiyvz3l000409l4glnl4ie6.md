## About the Palace Museum

Established in 1925, the Palace Museum is installed in the imperial palace of two consecutive dynasties - the Ming (1368-1644) and the Qing (1644-1911). The magnificent architecture, also known as the Forbidden City, and the vast holdings of the imperial collections of paintings, calligraphy, ceramics, and decorative objects make it one of the most prestigious museums in China and the world at large.

## My Role

I led the dev team and collaborated with the designers of UI and content design between 4 Jan 2013 and 18 May 2013. As the UX coordinator, I did research, structure, prototype for the project.

## Steps

The first stage of the project was to create as many concepts as we can. All the concepts should be interactive and based on the original collection of twelve beauties art. I provided several concepts and confirmed the practical ones with the client.

Another challenge for me was how to create a proper user experience to combine traditional Chinese art with interactive technology. By careful user research, I found if we slow down the dynamic effect, but provide the consistent movement of the dynamic element at the same time, the experience would match our expectation. To do that, I led dev team to develop a tool just for adjusting the speed and performance of the dynamic elements such as leaves and flames on the images.

## Highlights

The team tried to find a unique way to show the original scroll correctly. By concept creating and designing, I suggested that we could create a layer sliding effect to display to scroll. It was used in my last case: The Moon first, and the effort was awe-inspiring. We created subtle different moving speed for 3 layers. The final effect was very positive. All the demo testing users said it was the best effects they've ever seen in App Store that year.
