Seeing many people get laid off from tech companies brought back the memory of my first laid-off experience 😑

It was not good for sure, but I was lucky that I got the resident visa already at that time, and I got the UX working experience and the confidence that I could find another job soon. As an immigrant myself, totally understand how hard and challenging it is for an immigrant to find a job aligned with his/her career path 🥲

If you are a recruiter or hiring manager, consider giving immigrant job seekers more shots. Their competency of problem solving and resilience have been validated by the immigration experience itself, especially for those non-native speakers. They have a strong work ethic, and they may have different skill sets than domestic workers. They are multilingual, and can bring a fresh perspective to the workplace 💪

Just give them a chance, and the outcome is often better than you expected 🌈

看到很多人被科技公司解雇，我想起了我第一次被裁员的经历 😑

被裁员的感受肯定不好，但我很幸运，当时我已经拿到了居留签证，有了从事UX的工作经验和很快就能找到其他工作的信心。作为一个移民，我完全理解对于一个新移民来说，找到一份符合自己职业道路的工作是多么困难和具有挑战性 🥲

如果你是一个招聘人员或招聘经理，考虑给移民求职者更多的机会吧。他们解决问题的能力和抗压能力已经被移民经历本身所验证，尤其是对于那些非母语的人。他们会更努力地工作，而且他们可能有不同于本地员工的技能。他们精通多国语言，可以为工作场所带来全新的视角💪

只要给他们一个机会，结果往往比你预期的要好 🌈 (图片来源：Visualcapitalist)
