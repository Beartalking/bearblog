I just survived a scam. The damage was small, but the whole thing was wild. I need to share it, so you know what to look out for.

For the context, I’m pretty tech-savvy. I’ve been around social media for years and can spot most scams from a mile away. But this one still got me.

It started with a DM on Twitter. A person named “TorresCampbell8” claimed to be a reporter from TechCrunch, covering AI and tech. He wanted my perspective and asked to schedule a call. That didn’t sound odd. I’ve done similar interviews before, so I checked his profile. It looked legit—he’d been posting or reposting TechCrunch-like articles since last year, and his Twitter account said it was created in 2012. The only tiny red flag was the handle “TorresCampbell8,” but I shrugged it off.

He sent me a Calendly link to book a call via Twitter DM. I clicked. It seemed normal. I got a confirmation email with no Zoom or meeting link, but I figured he’d message one later. Then I went to sleep.

Next morning, I woke up and saw strange comments on one of my Twitter posts—people calling me a scammer. At first, I thought it was just trolls. Then a friend messaged me on WeChat with a screenshot of a tweet from my account pushing a crypto “opportunity.” It even had a contract address. My profile had been changed to say I was the founder of some crypto project. But by the time I checked Twitter, the tweet was gone. **Posted overnight while I was asleep, then deleted before I woke up**.

I tried to reach out to “Torres,” but he was gone. Blocked me. Ignored my messages. So I dug into Twitter’s settings. I checked “Security and account access” and saw Calendly had permission to **read and write tweets**. That was it: while I slept, someone likely used that authorization to post a scam tweet.

Looks like they targeted my account because it has a decent following. Scammers posted a “meme coin” link, hoping quick-buck crypto enthusiasts would jump in. And they did. Then the scammer deleted the tweet, so I wouldn’t notice. According to a friend who tracked the contract address, around 100 people fell for it, losing a few thousand dollars in total. Awful.

Everyone got hurt here. I’m a victim. The people who bought that fake coin are victims. Even the media outlet’s reputation got dragged into this. All because these scammers keep evolving.

Then I did a quick search and found a post from a real TechCrunch reporter - Mary(@bayareawriter) talking about this exact scam. That’s where I spotted the same username: TorresCampbell8. Damn.

Here’s what I learned:  
• Keep two-step authentication turned on, always.  
• Update your passwords often.  
• Be careful about app authorizations. Revoke anything you don’t absolutely need.

I’m going through all my accounts, extensions, apps - tightening everything. Stay cautious. If it happened to me, it can happen to anyone.

That’s my story. Stay safe. And always trust your instincts if something feels off.

## **睡梦中的推特骗局：我被冒牌记者套路了**

我刚刚才从一次诈骗中脱身。损失不大，但整个过程太离奇了。我必须分享这个经历，让大家有个防范。

我平时很熟悉网络，用社交媒体也很多年了，自以为能认出各种骗局。但这次还是中招了。

事情是从一个推特私信开始的。一个叫 “TorresCampbell8” 的人，自称是 TechCrunch 的记者，说他在做跟 AI 和科技相关的报道，想找我聊聊。听上去没什么问题。我以前也有接受过类似的采访请求，于是去他资料页看了看。他似乎从去年开始发或转一些看似像 TechCrunch 的文章，账号显示是 2012 年创建的。唯一让我稍微迟疑的是那个 “8” 的尾缀，但我没多想。

他发来一个 Calendly 链接让我约时间。我点开链接，流程看起来很正常，还收到了预定成功的确认邮件。只不过上面没有 Zoom 或其它会议连结，我想也许他会稍后再发。然后我就去睡觉了。

第二天早上醒来，发现我推特底下出现奇怪评论，有人骂我是骗子。一开始我以为又是网络喷子。接着我朋友在微信上发截图给我，说我的账号昨晚发了一条推文，推荐一个所谓的加密项目，还附带了合约地址。我头像和简介都被改了，看起来就像我是什么“创始人”。可等我上推特一看，那条推文已经被删掉。它是在我睡觉时发的，而我还没醒时就被删掉了。

我尝试联系那位 “Torres”，但他已把我拉黑，完全没有回应。于是我进推特的安全设置里翻记录，发现 Calendly 获得了读写我推文的权限。大概就是通过这层授权，对方在我睡着时发了诈骗信息。

估计他们是看中我账号粉丝还算多，就用我的账号发一个“meme coin”的链接，让想快速赚钱的人去买。等交易结束就删文，这样我自己都不会注意到。后来推友追查了那个合约地址，发现大概有上百人上当，损失了好几千美金。真是可怕。

其实大家都是受害者。我本人受到了连累，那些购买假币的人也被骗了，甚至媒体的声誉也被拖下水。这些骗子手段不断进化，叫人防不胜防。

后来我又去搜资料，发现一位真正 TechCrunch 记者 Mary 提过这个骗局。我在她的那篇报道里，又看到了 “TorresCampbell8” 这个熟悉的账号。真是气人。

我从这次经历学到：  
• 一定要开两步验证。  
• 定期更改密码。  
• 对各种应用授权要多留神，能少给就少给。

现在我打算全面排查自己的所有账号、浏览器扩展、授权应用。虽然麻烦，但值当。大家一定要提高警惕。我中招了，你也可能会。

以上就是我的故事。希望你能平安无事，也别忘了凡事多留个心眼。
