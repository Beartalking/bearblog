## Creating team avatars with Figma and Procreate!

I did some team doodles for my design team last year, and the result was really good. Now I think, why not create something similar for the product team and developers Iâ€™m working with?

This time, I took it to another level: not only draw avatars for each person of the same size but also componentize them. I put the avatars in

[Figma](https://www.linkedin.com/company/figma/)

and created a component background which is easy to customize colors or styles.

Result? So good! Everyone loves it! And some peers immediately changed their Slack thumbnails - a great way to finish Fridayâ€™s work ðŸ˜ƒ
