1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,320
 This could be a quick one.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,760
 I want to introduce a tool that I'm recently

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,880
 fell in love with.

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,480
 And you probably also can notice there are many videos

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,000
 recently, be published on product homes

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,360
 or Twitter using a stylish graceful video recording style.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,440
 So Screen Studio.

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,960
 This is a tool I'm using.

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,000
 And I want to introduce myself to you today.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Let's first go to some other products for comparison.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,120
 So I'm using many different video recording apps,

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,000
 such as ScreenFlow, even the quick time

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,200
 as the default option and OBS studio, other things.

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,840
 So here in this table, you can see the difference

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,000
 between those tools.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,120
 And the Screen Studio, the two I want to introduce today,

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,839
It provides a few free features so that you can record.

18
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:03,360
 But also, with the paid version, it's a super powerful tool.

19
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,800
 And it's supported by many different platforms.

20
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,720
 And what is great is the feature.

21
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,120
 Because I cannot introduce it lively

22
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,360
 like how the Screen Studio looks like.

23
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,920
 Let's just check the website, and from the screen shop

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,200
 of the website, you can probably see how it works.

25
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,440
 First, what I really like is its simplicity.

26
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,920
 It's really simple to use.

27
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,480
 Like you just turn on this app, and it will filter out

28
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,000
 your camera, your audio inputs, and which screen

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,480
 you want to record a single window or an entire window.

30
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,160
 And yeah, just go for it.

31
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,120
 And then you can start to record.

32
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,040
 And also, it can record a window with a background

33
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,560
 with a really stylish background such as this.

34
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,640
 So this is what I really like.

35
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,800
 Sometimes we want to focus on the window

36
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,280
 or the feature so that people can see something different.

37
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,560
 And this is a really good feature.

38
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:18,040
 But also, it can zoom in by following your cursor.

39
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,640
 What you probably noticed is that here, for example,

40
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,200
 In this video, by moving the cursor,

41
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,880
 it will automatically follow the cursor

42
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,399
 so that people can see where you are.

43
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:36,799
 And also, with some visual effects,

44
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:40,519
 you can see the blurring or the tapping.

45
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:46,519
 So it looks like a studio-level of producing production

46
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,080
 level for the video.

47
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,040
 So this is something I've been looking for for a long time.

48
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,440
 And from other tools like ScreenFlow or even QuickTime,

49
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,360
 it's not available.

50
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,360
 But now we have this high-quality video as our content.

51
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,960
 And also, currently, it can export in GIF immediately

52
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:16,280
 without any other plugins or other actual tools,

53
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,320
 which is amazing.

54
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,600
 Also, speaking of the things I really like,

55
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,240
 I really like the selfie camera.

56
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,120
 Because sometimes, if you want to create some content

57
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,120
 and using different cameras, it will be so hard to set it down.

58
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,240
 And to be honest, it's in creating some pressure

59
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,560
 to talk out loud as a talking head with any strings.

60
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,080
 But now, as a how-to video, we just simply click and start

61
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,840
 to record is similar as Loom, but in a different way,

62
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,160
 in a more stylish way.

63
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,920
 And there are other things that I like.

64
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,520
 You can also find it on the website.

65
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,280
 But also, I think there is something

66
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,120
 could be improved.

67
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,360
 For example, the exporting speed is really slow at the moment.

68
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,720
 It takes such a long time.

69
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,720
 Maybe because my laptop is not as fast as the latest model.

70
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,600
 But still, I think something could be improved.

71
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,519
 And also, I think the Zoom effect is good.

72
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,040
 But sometimes, because it's automatically

73
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,120
 add to the feature and to your video.

74
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,520
 And sometimes, it seems overused.

75
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,080
 And I need to manually adjust it to make it

76
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,560
 not that dizzing.

77
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,719
 So this is another.

78
00:04:31,719 --> 00:04:34,840
 And also, I think currently

79
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:40,560
 It doesn't support cut a clip, edit or split.

80
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,680
 So other things, but you can see from the website,

81
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,720
 there's a roadmap.

82
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,160
 This is another thing that I really like.

83
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,440
 That developer puts all the things here on the website

84
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,480
 as the roadmap.

85
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,400
 So here is something the team is working on it,

86
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,400
 like plotting basic video editing tools, which is great.

87
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,600
 That the things I'm looking for.

88
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,840
 And add in captions, great.

89
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,520
 And also, something planned for the next round,

90
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,560
 like recording iOS devices.

91
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,760
 That would be awesome.

92
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,760
 And four text slides.

93
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,760
 So yeah, slowly, it probably will become

94
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,320
 Stand-alone tool for the whole video production flow.

95
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,799
 So that would be amazing.

96
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:33,039
 So yeah, I just like to record this video as a short review.

97
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,039
 I really love this tool.

98
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,120
 And thanks to the ScreenStudio team that provide

99
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,960
 this reading code that I can test and review it.

100
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,360
 And also, I think it's really, really valuable

101
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,000
 from anyone who wants to create some great quality

102
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,200
 video content for your platform, for your channels,

103
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,800
 or for your social media.

104
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,920
 Right, this is Bear.

105
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,160
 And thanks for watching.

106
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,360
 See you next time.

107
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,200
 Ciao.

108
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:10,320
æ¥½ music playing.
