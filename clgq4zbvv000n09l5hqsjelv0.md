1 00:00:00,000 --&gt; 00:00:01,320 This could be a quick one.

2 00:00:01,320 --&gt; 00:00:03,760 I want to introduce a tool that I'm recently

3 00:00:03,760 --&gt; 00:00:04,880 fell in love with.

4 00:00:04,880 --&gt; 00:00:09,480 And you probably also can notice there are many videos

5 00:00:09,480 --&gt; 00:00:12,000 recently, be published on product homes

6 00:00:12,000 --&gt; 00:00:18,360 or Twitter using a stylish graceful video recording style.

7 00:00:18,360 --&gt; 00:00:22,440 So Screen Studio.

8 00:00:22,440 --&gt; 00:00:23,960 This is a tool I'm using.

9 00:00:23,960 --&gt; 00:00:27,000 And I want to introduce myself to you today.

10 00:00:27,000 --&gt; 00:00:33,000 Let's first go to some other products for comparison.

11 00:00:33,000 --&gt; 00:00:37,120 So I'm using many different video recording apps,

12 00:00:37,120 --&gt; 00:00:40,000 such as ScreenFlow, even the quick time

13 00:00:40,000 --&gt; 00:00:45,200 as the default option and OBS studio, other things.

14 00:00:45,200 --&gt; 00:00:47,840 So here in this table, you can see the difference

15 00:00:47,840 --&gt; 00:00:49,000 between those tools.

16 00:00:49,000 --&gt; 00:00:54,120 And the Screen Studio, the two I want to introduce today,

17 00:00:54,120 --&gt; 00:00:57,839 It provides a few free features so that you can record.

18 00:00:57,839 --&gt; 00:01:03,360 But also, with the paid version, it's a super powerful tool.

19 00:01:03,360 --&gt; 00:01:08,800 And it's supported by many different platforms.

20 00:01:08,800 --&gt; 00:01:11,720 And what is great is the feature.

21 00:01:11,720 --&gt; 00:01:15,120 Because I cannot introduce it lively

22 00:01:15,120 --&gt; 00:01:18,360 like how the Screen Studio looks like.

23 00:01:18,360 --&gt; 00:01:22,920 Let's just check the website, and from the screen shop

24 00:01:22,920 --&gt; 00:01:26,200 of the website, you can probably see how it works.

25 00:01:26,200 --&gt; 00:01:31,440 First, what I really like is its simplicity.

26 00:01:31,440 --&gt; 00:01:32,920 It's really simple to use.

27 00:01:32,920 --&gt; 00:01:37,480 Like you just turn on this app, and it will filter out

28 00:01:37,480 --&gt; 00:01:41,000 your camera, your audio inputs, and which screen

29 00:01:41,000 --&gt; 00:01:45,480 you want to record a single window or an entire window.

30 00:01:45,480 --&gt; 00:01:47,160 And yeah, just go for it.

31 00:01:47,160 --&gt; 00:01:49,120 And then you can start to record.

32 00:01:49,120 --&gt; 00:01:54,040 And also, it can record a window with a background

33 00:01:54,040 --&gt; 00:01:57,560 with a really stylish background such as this.

34 00:01:57,560 --&gt; 00:01:59,640 So this is what I really like.

35 00:01:59,640 --&gt; 00:02:03,800 Sometimes we want to focus on the window

36 00:02:03,800 --&gt; 00:02:07,280 or the feature so that people can see something different.

37 00:02:07,280 --&gt; 00:02:09,560 And this is a really good feature.

38 00:02:09,560 --&gt; 00:02:18,040 But also, it can zoom in by following your cursor.

39 00:02:18,040 --&gt; 00:02:22,640 What you probably noticed is that here, for example,

40 00:02:22,640 --&gt; 00:02:26,200 In this video, by moving the cursor,

41 00:02:26,200 --&gt; 00:02:28,880 it will automatically follow the cursor

42 00:02:28,880 --&gt; 00:02:31,399 so that people can see where you are.

43 00:02:31,399 --&gt; 00:02:36,799 And also, with some visual effects,

44 00:02:36,799 --&gt; 00:02:40,519 you can see the blurring or the tapping.

45 00:02:40,519 --&gt; 00:02:46,519 So it looks like a studio-level of producing production

46 00:02:46,520 --&gt; 00:02:49,080 level for the video.

47 00:02:49,080 --&gt; 00:02:52,040 So this is something I've been looking for for a long time.

48 00:02:52,040 --&gt; 00:02:56,440 And from other tools like ScreenFlow or even QuickTime,

49 00:02:56,440 --&gt; 00:02:57,360 it's not available.

50 00:02:57,360 --&gt; 00:03:02,360 But now we have this high-quality video as our content.

51 00:03:04,280 --&gt; 00:03:09,960 And also, currently, it can export in GIF immediately

52 00:03:09,960 --&gt; 00:03:16,280 without any other plugins or other actual tools,

53 00:03:16,280 --&gt; 00:03:18,320 which is amazing.

54 00:03:18,320 --&gt; 00:03:21,600 Also, speaking of the things I really like,

55 00:03:21,600 --&gt; 00:03:23,240 I really like the selfie camera.

56 00:03:23,240 --&gt; 00:03:27,120 Because sometimes, if you want to create some content

57 00:03:27,120 --&gt; 00:03:32,120 and using different cameras, it will be so hard to set it down.

58 00:03:32,120 --&gt; 00:03:35,240 And to be honest, it's in creating some pressure

59 00:03:35,240 --&gt; 00:03:40,560 to talk out loud as a talking head with any strings.

60 00:03:40,560 --&gt; 00:03:44,080 But now, as a how-to video, we just simply click and start

61 00:03:44,080 --&gt; 00:03:47,840 to record is similar as Loom, but in a different way,

62 00:03:47,840 --&gt; 00:03:50,160 in a more stylish way.

63 00:03:50,160 --&gt; 00:03:53,920 And there are other things that I like.

64 00:03:53,920 --&gt; 00:03:57,520 You can also find it on the website.

65 00:03:57,520 --&gt; 00:03:59,280 But also, I think there is something

66 00:03:59,280 --&gt; 00:04:00,120 could be improved.

67 00:04:00,120 --&gt; 00:04:03,360 For example, the exporting speed is really slow at the moment.

68 00:04:03,360 --&gt; 00:04:04,720 It takes such a long time.

69 00:04:04,720 --&gt; 00:04:09,720 Maybe because my laptop is not as fast as the latest model.

70 00:04:09,720 --&gt; 00:04:12,600 But still, I think something could be improved.

71 00:04:12,600 --&gt; 00:04:17,519 And also, I think the Zoom effect is good.

72 00:04:17,519 --&gt; 00:04:20,040 But sometimes, because it's automatically

73 00:04:20,040 --&gt; 00:04:23,120 add to the feature and to your video.

74 00:04:23,120 --&gt; 00:04:25,520 And sometimes, it seems overused.

75 00:04:25,520 --&gt; 00:04:29,080 And I need to manually adjust it to make it

76 00:04:29,080 --&gt; 00:04:30,560 not that dizzing.

77 00:04:30,560 --&gt; 00:04:31,719 So this is another.

78 00:04:31,719 --&gt; 00:04:34,840 And also, I think currently

79 00:04:34,840 --&gt; 00:04:40,560 It doesn't support cut a clip, edit or split.

80 00:04:40,560 --&gt; 00:04:44,680 So other things, but you can see from the website,

81 00:04:44,680 --&gt; 00:04:45,720 there's a roadmap.

82 00:04:45,720 --&gt; 00:04:48,160 This is another thing that I really like.

83 00:04:48,160 --&gt; 00:04:54,440 That developer puts all the things here on the website

84 00:04:54,440 --&gt; 00:04:55,480 as the roadmap.

85 00:04:55,480 --&gt; 00:04:59,400 So here is something the team is working on it,

86 00:04:59,400 --&gt; 00:05:03,400 like plotting basic video editing tools, which is great.

87 00:05:03,400 --&gt; 00:05:05,600 That the things I'm looking for.

88 00:05:05,600 --&gt; 00:05:07,840 And add in captions, great.

89 00:05:07,840 --&gt; 00:05:10,520 And also, something planned for the next round,

90 00:05:10,520 --&gt; 00:05:14,560 like recording iOS devices.

91 00:05:14,560 --&gt; 00:05:15,760 That would be awesome.

92 00:05:15,760 --&gt; 00:05:18,760 And four text slides.

93 00:05:18,760 --&gt; 00:05:22,760 So yeah, slowly, it probably will become

94 00:05:22,760 --&gt; 00:05:27,320 Stand-alone tool for the whole video production flow.

95 00:05:27,320 --&gt; 00:05:28,799 So that would be amazing.

96 00:05:28,799 --&gt; 00:05:33,039 So yeah, I just like to record this video as a short review.

97 00:05:33,039 --&gt; 00:05:35,039 I really love this tool.

98 00:05:35,040 --&gt; 00:05:39,120 And thanks to the ScreenStudio team that provide

99 00:05:39,120 --&gt; 00:05:42,960 this reading code that I can test and review it.

100 00:05:42,960 --&gt; 00:05:45,360 And also, I think it's really, really valuable

101 00:05:45,360 --&gt; 00:05:49,000 from anyone who wants to create some great quality

102 00:05:49,000 --&gt; 00:05:52,200 video content for your platform, for your channels,

103 00:05:52,200 --&gt; 00:05:54,800 or for your social media.

104 00:05:54,800 --&gt; 00:05:55,920 Right, this is Bear.

105 00:05:55,920 --&gt; 00:05:57,160 And thanks for watching.

106 00:05:57,160 --&gt; 00:05:58,360 See you next time.

107 00:05:58,360 --&gt; 00:05:59,200 Ciao.

108 00:05:59,200 --&gt; 00:06:10,320 楽 music playing.
