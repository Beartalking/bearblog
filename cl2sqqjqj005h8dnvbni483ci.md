## Books that I read in Feb

I saw many videos on YouTube sharing, "I read one book a week for a year, and it changed my life". I don't think reading changed my life, as it is how I live my life. I've been reading one book a week for six years. Reading helps me learn new skills, explore unknown domains, or just get lost in my imagination, history, or time.

Books I read in Feb:

💡 The Making of a Manager by Julie Zhuo. So good! This prob the must-read book for professionals on career growth!

💡 The Urban Sketching Handbook Architecture and Cityscapes. Learned lots of tips for sketching!

💡 The Bomber Mafia by Malcolm Gladwell: prob the best audiobook that I've ever listened to so far (from 150+ audiobooks)

💡 Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir: It was the recommended Sci-fi of the year, and I really like The Martian.

# 每月一次的读书总结（2022年2月）
二月读完了四本书，和一月一样。

• Julie Zhuo的The Making of a Manager。职场提升必读。
• Van Life：房车（货车）生活，看看逃离一代在路上的生活方式。
• Bomber Mafia（《轰炸机黑帮》），最会讲故事的大师精心制作的世界级最高水准非虚构类有声书。
• Project Hail Mary（《圣玛利计划》），宏大且硬核的科幻设定，近两年读得最过瘾的一部硬科幻。

三月目前计划读：

• Micro Trends（微趋势），比尔盖茨和克林顿的咨询顾问写的书，很有意思，用数字和事实分析各种主流后面的暗流趋势。
• 都市速写（已读完）
• 失落的卫星：在读。
• 午夜降临前抵达。很喜欢刘子超的文笔，打算顺着追完他的书。
