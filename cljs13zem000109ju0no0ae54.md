### High-stake videos on YouTube

We all love YouTube, don't we? It's an incredible platform for learning new things, being entertained, and even for picking up new hobbies. Today, I want to share my latest approach for learning high-stake content on YouTube. Exciting, right? Let's dive in.

So, how do I differentiate between high-stake and low-stake content? It's simple. I categorize it based on its value to me.

For instance, we all watch entertaining videos, read fun articles, and once we're done with them, that's it, right? But then, there are some contents that impart useful information or inspire us, which we might want to revisit later. Think of it as watching a cooking video; you'll want to try it later, right? That's what I call useful content.

To be more precise, I divide these useful contents into high-stake and low-stake. High-stake content has the potential to bring profound or fundamental changes to my work or lifestyle. If I pick up a new design process technique that can enhance my work and benefit my career, that's high-stake content.

On the other hand, the cooking video example I mentioned earlier? While it's useful, it's not exactly life-changing. So, I categorize it as low-stake content.

### Tools: FigJam, ChatGPT and

Today, I want to share my approach to consuming high-stake content and how I ensure I remember everything I learn. Given the value of high-stake content, it's worth spending extra time on note-taking. To do this effectively, I use three tools - FigJam, ChatGPT, and sometimes FreeForm app on Mac and iOS.

### How it works

The method is pretty straightforward. First, I consume the content, then I use AI - ChatGPT, to be exact, to analyze and help me clarify my notes. In essence, I'm co-piloting with an AI.

One fundamental rule I adhere to is making everything visual. I'm a visual learner, and I find that when I see graphical images and quotes all in one place, it becomes much easier to absorb the information from the content.

I then use Notion to combine all my learning into a consolidated, searchable learning note page. All the tools I use are free, except perhaps if you're using GPT-4 for analyzing content, but GPT-3.5 works just fine as well.

Now, let's dive deeper into how I do this (please check the video for this step)
