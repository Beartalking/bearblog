Finally read Just Enough Research by Erika Hall during the holiday, which has been on my reading list for a while. Wow! I feel bad after reading this book: why didn’t I read it when I started my UX design career!? I would avoid so many pitfalls and have many better outcomes if I followed some suggestions from this book!

I’ll review the book from a personal point of view later (if you are interested, Erika summarised her book in [this awesome video](https://youtu.be/5WtB5FRn-Sc) ), and just attach my book notes for now. Five things that blew my design mind from this book:

1️⃣ Surveys are the most difficult research method of all.

2️⃣ Test a competitor’s product before you even put pencil to paper. Then test some sketches. And then test at every stage as much as you can.

3️⃣ When blue-sky thinking meets reality, reality always wins.

4️⃣ The first rule of user research: never ask anyone what they want.(You risk the scope of your ideas being limited by the imaginations of others. )

5️⃣ Quotes that represent the perspectives of research participants are often the most powerful, portable output of user research.

Thanks, Erika, for writing this great book!
