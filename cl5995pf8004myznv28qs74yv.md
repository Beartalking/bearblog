## Problems mean opportunities: I moved my podcast to a new platform

Problems mean opportunities - that's so true.

I got an email this week from my podcast server provider which said my podcast was downloaded so many times (3.75M so far in 2 years), and they cannot afford the bandwidth.  They decided to raise the price from $30 per month to $150!
(So it seems the so-called ‘unlimited plan’ is not real unlimited)

I think it's a good time to move on - did some research about replatform and found a really good provider, which took me half an hour for the whole replatform process. Now my podcast is in a new place with better features and a lower price. Without this pain point to force me to move on,  I would stay at the status quo.

It's also similar to our career and life decisions. **Challenge and struggle mean opportunities to change, or even better: improvement.**

我将播客迁移到了新的平台

有问题就有机会：前几天收到播客服务商的信，说要把我的播客收费涨价，从现在的两个播客，37美元/月涨到150美元/月！肉痛之下我一通调研猛如虎，找到一个更好的选择，完全一样甚至更好的服务，还有全局插入广告的功能（我一直想要的功能），收费只是12美元/月。

目前迁移中。迁移也是自动化的，点几下鼠标，20分钟应该就搞定。最多再重新配置一下域名，1小时内迁移完400多期几百G的节目，也是厉害了。

成熟的商业社会真好，你跟不上，我就换平台，用脚投票。服务器、工具、工作啊，都这样。
