## Thoughts on 'finding yourself'

Many motivational articles or videos mention you should  "find yourself", and I'm not a fan of it. I'm in my 40s, and I can't say I found myself. The verb here is incorrect: "find" only has two states, and life is much more complicated than that.

“Learn” is a better verb, as learning is a continuous process. I'm in my 40's, and I'm still learning who I am.
