Hello, designers,

I just went through the latest trends article from \[UX Collective\]([https://trends.uxdesign.cc/](https://trends.uxdesign.cc/)), and honestly, 2024 feels like a year where the UX spotlight dims a bit. After years of being front and center, it seems we’ve reached the end of a big boom.

The industry is pulling back, prioritizing business goals while AI quietly takes over tasks we used to own. It’s not a sudden shift, but it’s definitely changing opportunities–and roles.

This year’s been…different. Designers aren’t just designing anymore. We’re being asked to deliver more–sitting through meetings to align with business goals, while still focusing on customer needs.

I’ve felt my own creativity take a hit. Maybe you have too? That’s okay. Change is messy, and adapting takes energy.

So, where do we go from here? 2025 is about choosing a direction–or two. You don’t have to stick with one forever, but leaning into one or two can really help you grow. Here are the options:

### **🗺️ Path 1: Shift from Screen Designer to Strategy Designer**

Designers who “get” business goals are becoming invaluable. It’s not just about making things look good–it’s about solving real problems. This path is about stepping up as a strategic partner, not just a pixel pusher. Learn to use data to back up your designs, understand revenue impact, and speak the language of leadership. If you can connect design to strategy, you’ll lead the conversation instead of following it.

### **🚀 Path 2: Build Faster, Ship Smarter**

The design process is evolving, and speed is key. Products don’t have to take months to develop, but they do need to work. With tools like Framer, AI, and other no-code solutions, we can design and ship efficiently. This path is about being effective–prototyping, testing, and releasing without sacrificing quality. It’s about delivering value, fast.

### **🎨 Path 3: Perfect Your Craft**

Sometimes, it’s not about trends–it’s about being so good at what you do that no one can ignore you. Sharpening your skills in prototyping, UI design, or research never goes out of style. This is where you double down on details, ensuring your work is polished and convincing. That’s why we love design, right? It’s not just a job–it’s our craft. That’s what makes it all worth it.

The beauty of these paths? You can mix and match, or shift as your career evolves. But leaning into one or two at a time gives you focus and helps you stand out.

What stays constant? The basics: understanding people, staying resilient, and keeping a growth mindset. These fundamentals never go out of style, no matter how much the industry shifts.

So, what’s your next move? Let’s make 2025 a year of progress–even if it looks a little different than we’re used to.
