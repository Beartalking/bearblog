> *One of the learning notes that I took from Config 2023.*

Watched the Stripe keynote session at Config, presented by Katie Dill and David Singleton. It was packed with insights and only took 30 minutes of my time. I also experimented with consuming the information first, and then later used AI to create learning notes.

Here are my four steps:

* ✅ Gather the speaker information and note down why I want to watch the session or what I expect to gain from it.
    
* ✅ Watch the session and take notes in FigJam.
    
* ✅ Use ChatGPT to analyze the video and my raw notes, and then get back to me with refined learning notes (friendly for those without context).
    
* ✅ Get all the things together in FigJam so I can review later.
    

I believe people should first consume the content, get some input, and then use AI to clarify things. We shouldn’t just go straight to AI-generated content.

Attached are my learning notes for your reference. This was a fantastic session. Thanks for sharing, Katie and David!

The talk titled “Rethinking Product Building” at Config 2023 featured Katie Dill, Head of Design, and David Singleton, Chief Technology Officer, at Stripe. They discussed how design and engineering can come together to build exceptional products and strategies for fostering a culture of collaboration, experimentation, and continuous improvement.

Key insights include:

* **Collaboration**: Design and development teams must work closely together, understanding the intricacies of user experience (UX) to improve the product. There is no real hand-off between teams; instead, everyone continuously contributes micro-updates, fostering a collaborative environment.
    
* **Mission Teams**: These are cross-functional teams, including subject matter experts, working side-by-side to ensure that everyone involved in a project is working towards the same goal.
    
* **Short Feedback Loops**: Stripe’s approach to billing was used as an example of keeping a tight feedback loop, continuously improving the product based on user feedback.
    
* **Balance of Innovation and Drudgery**: Innovation doesn’t always happen in leaps and bounds; sometimes, it’s the result of diligent work over time, even if it seems mundane or boring. Focusing on these “boring” problems can bring great value to users.
    
* **Importance of Small Details**: Compounding effort on small details can pay off in the long run. Visual details, in particular, are crucial for communicating trust to the users.
    
* **User-Centred Development**: Alpha users often test new features, and their feedback is invaluable in improving the product. Companies should understand the user’s Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD)—what they want to achieve with the product—and iterate closely with users.
    
* **Friction Logging Rituals**: Before launching, teams go through a process of logging and resolving friction points, even if the scenario seems messy. This ensures the product is as user-friendly as possible at launch.
    
* **Learning from Big Companies**: Practices from large companies like Google, Apple, and Airbnb were mentioned. For example, Airbnb’s practice of sharing screenshots shows what individuals are working on across design, product management, and marketing teams.
    
* **Excitement about the Future**: The future value of AI was a notable point of discussion. AI can help with information overload, a common pain point for many companies. For instance, Stripe uses machine learning and is exploring the use of AI interfaces like ChatGPT for business data. The goal is to assist in better creative thinking and decision-making. This talk reinforced the importance of user-driven product development, continuous improvement, and the potential of AI in enhancing business processes. It highlighted the value of focusing on the finer details, the balance between innovation and steady work, and the power of cross-functional collaboration.
