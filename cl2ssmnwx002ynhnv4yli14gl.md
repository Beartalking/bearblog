## You can focus on things you like

Now I'm 40, and I finally learned this: you don't need to follow the trend. You don't need to follow other people’s attention. It's okay to just focus on your domain and care about the things you care about. If people talk about sport, football, bitcoin, rugby, or other things you don't care about, just don't. And that's okay.

现在我40岁了，我终于明白了这一点：你不需要跟风。 你不需要关注别人的注意力。 只关注你的领域并关心你关心的事情是可以的。 如果人们谈论运动、足球、比特币、橄榄球或其他你不关心的事情，那就不要操心。 没关系。
